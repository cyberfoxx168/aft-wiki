        After The Flash: Wintertide is a multiplayer post-apocalyptic
        roleplaying game created by ChadTheCreator and Flashstorm Interactive,
        the eighth main game and twelfth installment in the After the Flash
        series and the first game in the updated timeline - which features new
        lore, factions, and technology - and the successor of After the Flash:
        Mirage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game takes place on the Sunrise Islands, a fictional archipelago
        located slightly north of mainland Ohio, during the decade of the 2160s.
        The game began in the year 2161, 90 years after the bombs fell. The
        story of the game focuses on the conflicts, life, war, and events of the
        Sunrise Islands.

      <h2 id="1">The Flash</h2>
      <p>
        The years before the Flash were mostly peaceful. Many of the historical
        points in time before the Flash are unknown by your everyday wastelander
        these days, however certain key elements remain known. In the United
        States, Land was annexed and put into the Union; there was an Atlantic
        Union trade zone; Africa had an economic boom; humanoid AI had been
        developed; space elevators were built, etc. The US was largely
        isolationist and peaceful before a dirty nuke was detonated in San
        Francisco, which drove the US into a vengeful imperialist frenzy in the
        2060s, culminating in an apocalyptic nuclear war in the year 2071. Most
        in hindsight say it was World War 3. Some older folks say it started in
        Africa; some say it started after the economic collapse in East Asia;
        most just have conspiracy theories and lay blame on every population not
        including their own.

      <h3>Locations</h3>
      <h4 id="2">Sunrise City</h4>
      <p>
        A once proud space engineering city along the coast of Lake Erie,
        Sunrise City now lies in a dormant state of ruin. The towers which once
        stood tall against the clouds are now decrepit, and the roads are
        cracking and packed with overgrowth. The original residents of the city
        are gone, being replaced with scavengers hoping to find something of
        use, bandits prowling the streets, the patrols of numerous factions, and
        Mutants which creep in the shadows.
      </p>
      <img src="/OIP (2).jpg" alt="" />
      <h4 id="3">Alumni Fortress</h4>
      <p>
        The members of the Alumni have settled in the ruined campus of the
        once-proud Erie Institute of Technology. The Fortress is a rather
        sprawling settlement, with the once-ruins of buildings now settled by
        the Alumni and transformed into something of their use. The Alumni let
        anyone in, but on the condition that they have good or neutral relations
        with the faction and that they don't enter any of the private buildings.
        The Fortress is well-known for the enigmatic Compendium tower, which
        supposedly houses the Alumni's technological research.
      </p>
      <h4 id="4">Sunrise Maker Factory</h4>
      <p>
        A joint 3D-Printing factory and port that has fallen into disarray. The
        location contains the factory itself, a cluster of buildings and
        warehouses with abandoned technology and the never-finished shapes of
        3D-printed objects. The port is covered with shipping containers and the
        husks of old machinery, and a settlement comprised of fishermen has been
        created along one of the docks; a lively community in a dark time.
      </p>
      <h4 id="5">Bargetown</h4>
      <p>
        A scrap city which is a part of the Coalition, Bargetown is considered
        an island-wide safe zone. Situated on a barge which can move at will,
        Bargetown is a dense, cramped scrap city known for its food, stores,
        crime, and amenities. The settlement was formerly controlled by the
        Winthrop Dynasty, before being ousted in a coup. The lake around
        Bargetown has been frozen with ice, and it is not known if this inhbits
        the Barge's movement.
      </p>
      <h4 id="6">URSF Outpost</h4>
      <p>
        Located in a pre-flash monorail station, the USRF took control of the
        location, and transformed it into a small outpost. The Outpost is
        surrounded with various defensive measures, from barbed wire to security
        cameras. As of the USRF claiming of Black Mountain, the frontier outpost
        has been abandoned by the USRF.
      </p>
      <h4 id="7">The Quarry</h4>
      <p>
        The Quarry was once operated by an unknown construction company, who
        operated an advanced terraforming machine to dig into the Quarry. Today,
        the Terraformer is just another ruined piece of old world memorabilia,
        abandoned and doomed to rust in the pit it dug itself into, and the area
        is mainly only used as a site for prison mining by the various factions
        of the region.
      </p>
      <h4 id="8">Southpoint Village</h4>
      <p>
        Southpoint State is a loosely connected conglomerate of mutant tribes
        and communities, with it's head being the creatively named Southpoint
        Village, which harbors various sorts of peoples, from mutants who have
        been wronged by humanity, to the outcasts and fringes of human
        civilization. Southpoint Village has been locked in war with Bargetown
        since its arrival on the islands.
      </p>
      <img src="/OIP (1).jpg" alt="" />
      <h4 id="9">Sunrise Omniport</h4>
      <p>
        The Omniport was once a shining beacon of pre-war prosperity, a place
        not too indifferent from an airport, where various people around the
        islands could board strange vehicles, that had the means to transport
        them across the Lakes by air. As of today, it is another rotting
        memorial of the Old World.
      </p>
      <h4 id="10">Westside Farmhouse</h4>
      <p>
        A spanning farm estate, the Westside Farmhouse or Farm Estate contains a
        large farming site which can still be used today and an abandoned home,
        which can serve as a shelter if you're in a pinch.
